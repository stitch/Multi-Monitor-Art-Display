Modules are called with the function "Initialize". They are cleared with "Clear".

If you want to make a module called "foo", make sure all methods and CSS classes have the prefix foo.

So the initialize routine of foo, that will be automatically called is fooInitialize(). 
When your time is over the fooClear() function is executed.

A simple module for displaying four webpages thus looks like this.

/**
	<MODULE Websites>
*/
function websitesInitialize(){
	clearScreen();
	displayURLOnMonitor("monitor1", "https://hack42.nl/gallery/v/Spacecam/");
	displayURLOnMonitor("monitor2", "https://hack42.nl/spacestate/1wire/plattegrond.php#contentSub");
	displayURLOnMonitor("monitor3", "https://hack42.nl/wiki/Activiteiten?useskin=chick#toekomstig");
	displayURLOnMonitor("monitor4", "https://twitter.com/hack42");
}

function websitesClear(){
	clearScreen();
}
/**
	</MODULE websites>	
*/

Modules are stored in their own folders. They are loaded by script.js when specified.
